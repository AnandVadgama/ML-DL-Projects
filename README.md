# ML & DL Practice Projects

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating my hands-on practice with key topics in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).

- 📚 **Purpose:** Practice, learning, and showcasing familiarity with ML/DL concepts and workflows.
- 🛠️ **Format:** All projects are implemented as Jupyter notebooks for easy exploration and reproducibility.
- 🧠 **Topics covered:**  
  - Classical ML algorithms (regression, classification, clustering, etc.)
  - Deep Learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow
  - Data preprocessing, model evaluation, and more

Feel free to browse the notebooks in the `ML Projects` and `DL Projects` folders!
